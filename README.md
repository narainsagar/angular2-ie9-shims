angular2-IE9-shims
==================

Shims to make angular2 RC1 work on IE9(+)

**Note:** It has been pulled from: 
- the cdn:

https://npmcdn.com/angular2@2.0.0-beta.17/es6/dev/src/testing/shims_for_IE.js
- or the package:

node_modules/angular2/es6/dev/src/testing/shims_for_IE.js

^It can be used as a temporary workaround for now in app (for angular2 RC1 module only), until the underlying libraries are fixed to include this polyfill(s).
